## Creation

- Create React App was used to initialize the project.

- Set up ESlint

- Checked out the shape of the JSON file to determine the file structure before writing any components

- Broke up the Feed stream into 3 different components to display each feed in the JSON file

- After adding Semantic UI I noticed that the 3 different components had a lot more overlap than I originally thought.  They were refactored into 2

- Final step was using Semantic UI to provide a more user-friendly interface

## Thoughts

- Semantic UI was interesting and fun to use once I got used to it

- With more time I would have played around with Semantic UI more to make the website stand out that much more

- Another change I would make is to either differentiate the FeedItem and VideoItem components further or combine them into one as there is a lot of repeat code bewteen them

- If I were to approach a project like this again I would read up more on Semantic UI to integrate it from the beginning instead of adding it near the end
